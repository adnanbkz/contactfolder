# CONTACT FOLDER 📒
Contact Book Application in Java 

Welcome to the Contact Book Application in Java project! This repository is designed to help beginners understand data management and user interaction by creating a functional contact book.
📖 Description

The Contact Book Application is a beginner-friendly Java project that introduces key concepts in programming such as:

    Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
    File handling for persistent data storage.
    Using data structures like ArrayList to manage collections of data.
    Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

This application allows users to add, update, delete, and search for contact details, simulating the functionality of a basic address book.
🚀 Features

    Add Contacts: Enter details like name, phone number, and email address.
    View All Contacts: Display a list of all stored contacts.
    Update Contacts: Modify the details of existing contacts.
    Delete Contacts: Remove contacts from the list.
    Search Contacts: Find a contact by name or other criteria.
    Data Persistence: Contacts are saved to a file to retain data between sessions.

📦 Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

    Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
    A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
    Basic knowledge of Java syntax and concepts.

🛠️ Setup Instructions

    Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contact-book-java.git  

    Open the project in your preferred IDE.
    Compile and run the Main.java file to start the application.

📚 How It Works

    Main Menu: The program displays a menu with options for different actions (add, update, delete, search, view).
    User Interaction: Users can navigate through the menu to perform the desired action by entering their choice.
    Data Management: The program manages contacts using an ArrayList or similar structure and saves the data to a file for persistence.
    Error Handling: Input validation ensures the program runs smoothly even with incorrect inputs.

🌱 Learning Objectives

This project is perfect for beginners to learn:

    The fundamentals of OOP (classes, objects, encapsulation).
    Managing dynamic data using collections like ArrayList.
    Reading and writing files for data storage.
    Implementing basic algorithms for search and update operations.

🏆 Challenges

Want to enhance the application? Try these features:

    Advanced Search: Allow users to search by phone number or email in addition to the name.
    Sort Contacts: Add functionality to sort contacts alphabetically by name.
    Database Integration: Replace file-based storage with a database like MySQL for better scalability.
    Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implement the application with a GUI using JavaFX or Swing.
    Export/Import: Add options to export or import contacts in CSV format.
